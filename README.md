# CSSPageControlTimerProgress

Inspired by [@simonbs' toot](https://mastodon.social/@simonbs/110497868300095405) I built a quick demo of the new UIPageControlTimerProgress. Nothing fancy, nothing production-ready, just a bit of CSS/JS to see if it's possible.

Use at your own risk. This can hardly be considered finished. Nor supported ;)
